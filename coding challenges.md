### CODING CHALLENGES
### EASY CHALLENGES
for these questions i just used basic techniques and for the leap year question i learnt new syntax from google (TAKING INPUT AND USING IF AND ELSE IN THE SAME LINE)
the word file containing the screen shots is available in the repo and i am also attaching it here

### MEDIUM CHALLENGE
i have used two files of code for this project one file for server and onefile for client
i have refered to many yt videos  specially for hmac-sha512 i also used siources like gfg and w3 schools
for this challenge i learnt basics of socket programming and used the socket module for symetric key i have used fernet from cryptography module
for hmac-sha512 i have used hashlib and hmac modules
before sending every message there a symmetric key is generated by generate_key function and genrate_hmac function generates a hmac and the encrypt_message encrypts the message using the symmetric key generated 
then the final message is sent by mixing the symmetric key generated hmac and encrypted message
on the other side (file) the first 44 bytes are saved as key recieved the next bytes untilk the last 64 bytes as encrypted message and the last 64 bytes as hmac code
for knowing thwe length of symmetric key and hmac i used google
the decrypt_mnessage function decrypts the message and displays it only if the hmac on client and server side is the same other wise thje message is not displayed for this the hmac generated from symmetric key and encrypted message is compared with the recieved hmac
for socket programming i have used tcp method(SOCK_STREAM)
BOTH THE SERVER AND SOCKET ARE CONNECTED TO LOCAL HOST (port number 9999)
.listen() and .bind() are used for estaiblishing the connection 
on the client side .connect() is used on the client side to connect to the server side
.send() and .recv() is used for sending and recieving messages
i have uploaed the projectas a file ibn this repo
and also im adding link here

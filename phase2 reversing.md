### challenge1
this challenge required us to analyse the given binary files and find out the hidden flag so for getting the flag we needed to understand the assembly of the file for that i searched for reversing tools and installed ghidra after i uploaded the file to ghidra i got the "c" code of the file and after analysing the main code along with the the code for functions which were given in the main code i found the flag
### challenge 2
in this challenge a pyc file was given after decompiling the given pyc file we get a python code by analysing the code properly we understand that after giving the correct input we get the flag so i calcyulated the correct input and after giving that to the python program i got the flag
### challenge 3
this was similar to challenge 1 except that we need to give the correct password to the executable so to find that i used ghidra again and calculated what the password must be equal to and found out the flag
### challenge 4
this challenge didnt have a flag in it but rather if we give the correct input the code would validate our input on using ghidra again and anlysing the c code we can find out that if our inp
ut has "@" in the fifth position the input will be vaild and flag{"ourinput"} would be returned

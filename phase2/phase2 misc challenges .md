### challenge1
this challenge included a executable file after running that file i used strings command after observing the strings the last string was found to be encoded in base64 encoding so i decoded that and got a link to gist of a git repo there we can find a file which was in some encoding but i couldnt decode the file succesfully as i couldnt find what the encoding was
### challenge 2
the second challenge was a game in which we had to solve the questions which were based on encoding techniques i used pwn tools and after seeing the set of questions i have written the pythonscrip according to the leevls then for the third stage there was a custom encoding which only returned an example when capital letters were given as input so i gave every alphabet in capitalls and found out the custom technique and added code to my existing python script acc to that and got the flag finally
### challenge 3
this is a message which was encoded using wingdings encoding so i used online wingdings decoder and found the flag
### challenge 4
in this challenge we were given a txt file which had a message which was encoded multiple times after some googling i verfified that base64 was used i was not sure how many times it was encoded to save time i werote a python script to decode iot until i getr the final message and aslo sabed result of every decodprogram  after decoding the file we can find a python program which has the flag when the correct input was given gives the flag so i calculated the correct input and got the flag
### challenge 5
this is a message using hexadecimal encoding so i decoded the file and got what the message that was typed and kept in format of flag{*}

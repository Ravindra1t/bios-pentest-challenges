### REVERSING CHALLENGES
task 1 requires us to set a register for that we use "mov" function here we are setting rdi to 0x1337 so we use "mov rdi 0x1337"
registers are part of cpu which are used for fast processing 
###task2 
requires us to set multiple registers here also weuuse "mov" function we set rax to 0x1337 r12 to 0xCAFED00D1337BEEF, rsp to 0x31337
### task 3
for this task we have to add add 0x331337 to rdi for this we use "add" i.e "add rdi ,0x331337"
### task 5
for this task we are required to perform division
given  speed = distance / time, where
    distance = rdi
    time = rsi
    speed = rax now we use "div rdi rsi"
    and "mov rdi , rax" to save the result in rax
 ### task 4
 for this we have to multiply values and for that "imul" command is used
   f(x) = mx + b, where:
    m = rdi
    x = rsi
    b = rdx
    for adding the value of rdx we use "add"
  ### task 6
  here we use mod operator and the result is saved in rdx to savev the resuklt in rax we use "mov rdx rax"
  the task requires us to calculate the remainder and store it to rax
  ### task 7
  for this task we have to access upper 8 bits of rax for thatr we use "AH"
  so answer is "mov ah 0x42"
  ### task 8
  we are given a magic trick which says If we have "x % y", and y is a power of 2, such as 2^n, the result will be the lower n bits of x.

Therefore, we can use the lower register byte access to efficiently implement modulo!

and we are required to Please compute the following:
  rax = rdi % 256
  rbx = rsi % 65536

We will now set the following in preparation for your code:
  rdi = 0x7082
  rsi = 0x71133428
so we are required to acces the lower 8 bits of rdi and lower 16 bits of rsi
so we use "mov rax  dil"
"mov rbx si"
### task 9
bitwise shift 
for this we need to use shift functions we need to
  Set rax to the 5th least significant byte of rdi.
  so we use "shr rdi , 32"
  ### task 10
  for this we use "and" function
  we have to set rax = rdi AND rsi

i.e. Set rax to the value of (rdi AND rsi)
so we use rdi and rsi
then we use "add" function in sequence to have the resuklt in rax value since we are prohibited tio use mov function
### decompiling java files
for decompiling java files i have used a online java decompiler and uploaed these .class files to get a .java file upon alaysing them and truning the hex values the password is
flag{Kn0W_YoUR_A5C11}
after decompilin g the encrypted file i have got var values which are:
var 2 = G[Z@Z@G[VU_RT."
var3 = flag
